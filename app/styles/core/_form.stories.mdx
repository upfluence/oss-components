# Form standardization

To standardize forms accross the apps, global classes are created and should be used widely.

## Label

The label element is often used in forms, its style should be consistent throughout the apps.

An `oss-label` class is available to apply the label style to other HTML elements. Applied styles can be found in the **[\_form.less](https://github.com/upfluence/oss-components/blob/0f49ebb6fbda19e4f7cd418a8fb938f06adfba97/app/styles/core/_form.less)** file.
