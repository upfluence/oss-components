# Form standardization

To standardize forms accross the apps, global classes are created and should be used widely.

## Label

The label element is often used in forms, its style should be consistent through the apps.

An `oss-label` class is available to be able to apply the label style to other HTML elements. It applies the following style:

`font-size: var(--font-size-md);`

`color: var(--color-gray-500);`

`font-weight: 400;`
