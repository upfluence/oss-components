# Developer Guidelines

Various guidelines to ensure consistency and quality across the Upfluence Frontend Team.

## Tooling

At Upfluence, we use multiple tools allowing us following defined coding
standards both on our local development workstations AND our Continuous
Integration workflows.

### ESLint

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to encapsulate and enforce frontend code standards. Also,
because we are using Ember JS, we use [eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember)
to stay up to date on its standards too. You can find all settings for ESLint in `.eslintrc.js`.

To run ESLint locally, the projects all include the following **Yarn** scripts

```console
john@acme:~$ yarn lint:js
```

### Formatting with Prettier

Our code is automatically formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to follow the defined guidelines.
Prettier is taking care of formatting `.js`, `.html` and `.less` based on its standard
rules. You can find all settings for Prettier in `.prettierrc`.

For Installation based off your favorite code editor, please follow Prettier's
[Editor Integration documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
