# Developer Guidelines

Various guidelines to ensure consistency and quality across the Upfluence Frontend Team.

## Tooling

At Upfluence, we use multiple tools allowing us following defined coding
standards both on our local development workstations AND our Continuous
Integration workflows.

### ESLint

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to encapsulate and enforce frontend code standards. Also,
because we are using Ember JS, we use [eslint-plugin-ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember)
to stay up to date on its standards too. You can find all settings for ESLint in `.eslintrc.js`.

To run ESLint locally, the projects all include the following **pnpm** scripts

```console
john@acme:~$ pnpm lint:js
```

### Formatting with Prettier

Our code is  automatically formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to follow the defined guidelines.
Prettier is taking care of formatting `.js`, `.html`, `.hbs` and `.less` based on its standard
rules. You can find all settings for Prettier in `.prettierrc.js`.

For Installation based off your favorite code editor, please follow Prettier's
[Editor Integration documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

## Custom Assertions

To help testing the component, new `QUnit.assert` functions can be setup by adding the following code in `test-helper.ts`

```typescript
import * as QUnit from 'qunit';
import registerAssertions from '@upfluence/oss-components/test-support/register-assertions';
registerAssertions(QUnit.assert);
```

In oss-components project, all custom assertions are stored in `addon-test-support/custom-assertions`. The following code
gives you an example:

```typescript
import * as QUnit from 'qunit';

export interface CustomAssertions {
  exists(value: string, message?: string): void;
}

const assertion = (selector: string) => {
  return {
    exists(value:string, message?:string) {
      // your implementation
      QUnit.assert.pushResult({ result, actual, expected, message });
    }
  }
}

assertion.__name__ = 'yourCustomName';

export default assertion;

declare global {
  interface Assert {
    example(selector: string): CustomAssertions;
  }
}
```

How do you use it your tests? Just call the created function on `assert` with:

```typescript
assert.example('.your-selector').exists(value);
```
