  <h1>Welcome to Upfluence's Design System</h1>
</div>

OSS is a design system built to help Upfluence's developers and designers quickly
create the best experience for our clients. At Upfluence, we love to create
harmonious experiences for our users, solving challenging interactions once then
applying the solutions consistently across our products — making sure users only
have to learn them once.

## What is a design system?

Modern user interfaces are constructed from hundreds of UI components that are
endlessly reused to deliver different user experiences. Design systems catalog all the
reusable UI components to help teams assemble complex, yet durable UIs faster. Since
both designers and developers contribute to the UI components, the design system
serves as a bridge between disciplines. It is also the “source of truth” for an
organization’s common components.

## Installation 💻
