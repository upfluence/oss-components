  <h1>Welcome to Upfluence's OSS Design System</h1>
</div>

OSS is a design system built to help Upfluence's developers and designers quickly
create the best experience for our clients. At Upfluence, we love to create
harmonious experiences for our users, solving challenging interactions once then
applying the solutions consistently across our products ‚Äî making sure users only
have to learn them once.

## What is a design system?

Modern user interfaces are constructed from hundreds of UI components that are
endlessly reused to deliver different user experiences. Design systems catalog all the
reusable UI components to help teams assemble complex, yet durable UIs faster. Since
both designers and developers contribute to the UI components, the design system
serves as a bridge between disciplines. It is also the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for an
organization‚Äôs common components.

## Packages

Even though Ember JS is Upfluence's framework of choice, the OSS design system
codebase has been split into two packages. Based on which type of application
you're building you'll choose a different composition:

- [Our CSS/Assets](https://github.com/upfluence/oss) repository. Written using
  [Less CSS](http://lesscss.org/) preprocessor, this package holds all of the
  design system styles, including of course the ones used in our web components.
- [Our opinionated component library](https://github.com/upfluence/oss-components) which
  is actually an [Ember JS](https://emberjs.com/) addon and is home to the common
  components we use while developing amazing products.

## Installation üíª

Depending on the type of application you are building you have two ways of
installing the design system.

PS : Even though we are using **Yarn** as a package manager in the following
commands, those should work fine with **npm** too.

#### Preferred Installation

<p class="upf-align--center">
  <img src={EmberTomster} width="8%" />
</p>

<p>
  Yay üéä You are going with Ember JS, our framework of choice @ Upfluence. In order to install and use OSS, just follow
  the this simple steps:
</p>

```console
john@acme:~$ ember install ember-cli-less
john@acme:~$ ember install @upfluence/oss-components
```

```js
// project-name/ember-cli-build.js

module.exports = function (defaults) {
  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    lessOptions: {
      paths: ['node_modules/@upfluence/oss-components/app/styles']
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```

```css
// app/styles/app.less

@import 'oss-components';
```

And that's it ! Your app is now up and running with our amazing design system
üéâ „ÄÄ ü•≥ !

#### I am not using Ember JS

<p class="upf-align--center">
  <img src={JavascriptBundlers} width="35%" />
</p>

Our components' CSS is still usable even though you won't have a ready-to-use
solution but will need to apply the classes by yourself.

The installation by itself is pretty straightforward and consist of a single
command :

```console
john@acme:~$ yarn add upfluence-oss
```

Once the package installed, you can import it for usage following your preferred
JavaScript bundler's documentation.

#### I'm not using any framework and can't rely on a JavaScript bundler

You can still build a raw CSS file including its dependencies (Bootstrap) using
the LESS preprocessor CLI tool [(See Installation)](http://lesscss.org/usage/).

```console
john@acme:~$ git clone git@github.com:upfluence/oss.git
john@acme:~$ cd oss
john@acme:~$ yarn
john@acme:~$ lessc less/upfluence-oss.less --include-path=node_modules/bootstrap/less/ > oss.bundled.css
```
